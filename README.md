CK repository: Converting CLsmith tool (PLDI'15 artifact) to CK format
======================================================================

Status
======
This is a relatively stable repository demonstrating how to share
artifacts (tools and datasets) via CK. We converted CLsmith tool
for fuzz testing of OpenCL compilers into the CK format.

Prerequisites
=============
* Collective Knowledge Framework: http://github.com/ctuning/ck

Description
===========
CLsmith is a tool designed to address the compiler correctness problem 
for many-core systems through novel applications of fuzz testing to 
OpenCL compilers. It was shared as artifact along with the following
PLDI'15 paper:
 
http://multicore.doc.ic.ac.uk/publications/clsmith-pldi-15.html 

"Many-Core Compiler Fuzzing"
Christopher Lidbury, Andrei Lascu, Nathan Chong, Alastair F. Donaldson

We converted this artifact to CK format (finer-grain and reusable components),
shared it as standard CK repository on GitHub
and validated it via experiment crowdsourcing on several machines.

We also added this example to CK "Getting Started Guide" here:
* https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Autotuning-example-clsmith

CLsmith converted to CK can also serve as a template to describe 
and share other artifacts in CK format along with publications:
* AE PPoPP 2016: http://cTuning.org/event/ae-ppopp2016
* AE CGO 2016: http://cTuning.org/event/ae-cgo2016
* ADAPT 2016: http://adapt-workshop.org

Quick installation
============

```
$ sudo pip install ck
$ ck pull repo:ck-clsmith
```
